In this project, we're running a car service to transport 50 passengers from point a to point B (Randomly generated)
To do this, I coded multiple classes to run the service and survey how many passengers arrived at their location 
within a span of 32 different rides. I found that the amount of people transported to their destination directly
correlates to the amount of available cars. Logically, the more cars, the more eople arrive to their destination. 
When expirementing, I found that 40-60% of people completed their trips when there were 20 cars available. On the 
other hand, I found that 60-80% of passengers completed their trips when 40 cars were available. In conclusion, I 
ended up finding that having more cars present directly leads to having more passengers complete their journies, 
because each passenger has a slightly or majorly different stop.
